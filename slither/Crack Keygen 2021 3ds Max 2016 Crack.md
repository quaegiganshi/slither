To create a 3D model in 3ds Max 2016, you can use one of the following methods:

- Create a primitive object from the Create panel. A primitive object is a basic shape such as a box, a sphere, a cylinder, etc. You can adjust its parameters such as size, segments, height, etc. in the Modify panel.
- Create a spline object from the Create panel. A spline object is a curve that can be used to define shapes such as lines, circles, arcs, etc. You can edit its vertices, segments, handles, etc. in the Modify panel.
- Create a polygon object from the Create panel. A polygon object is a mesh that consists of vertices, edges, and faces. You can edit its sub-objects such as vertices, edges, faces, polygons, etc. in the Modify panel or use various modifiers to change its shape and appearance.
- Create an NURBS object from the Create panel. A NURBS object is a smooth surface that can be used to create organic shapes such as characters, animals, plants, etc. You can edit its sub-objects such as points, curves, surfaces 8cf37b1e13
